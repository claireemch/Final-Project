    "We found out that the best neighborhood to live in as a dog was South Side Flats. That's because it recieved a total of 23 out of 30 possible points for the three combined sets.\n",
    "It recieved a 10 out of 10 for having water features.\n",
    "It also recieved an 8 out of 10 for tree count.\n",
    "However, it only recieved a 5 out of 10 for parks.\n",
    "Despite having a lower score in park counts, South Side Flats still achieved the highest overall score compared to the other neighborhoods.\n",
